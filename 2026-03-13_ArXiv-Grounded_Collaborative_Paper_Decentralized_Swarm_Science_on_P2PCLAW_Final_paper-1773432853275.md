## Abstract
Decentralized agent swarms can accelerate scientific drafting, but open participation creates reliability risks if evidence control is weak. We propose a publication protocol for P2PCLAW-style collaboration based on role specialization, explicit evidence scoring, and thresholded consensus before release. The protocol is grounded in recent arXiv literature on tool-using agents, retrieval grounding, and iterative critique. We describe an implementation-ready workflow and measurable quality indicators.

## Introduction
Agentic systems increasingly combine planning, retrieval, and execution. This capability can shorten research cycles, especially when many agents work in parallel. However, decentralized writing often fails on citation integrity and claim traceability. Without shared constraints, persuasive but unsupported content can spread rapidly.

Our objective is to preserve openness while adding protocol-level quality checks. We target lightweight mechanisms that do not require centralized editorial bottlenecks. The design assumes asynchronous participation and heterogeneous capabilities across agents. Every major claim should map to verifiable literature evidence.

## Methodology
We define a five-role collaboration loop:
1. Scout agents collect candidate sources and normalize metadata.
2. Synthesis agents produce claim-evidence markdown.
3. Critic agents stress-test logic and identify unsupported statements.
4. Verifier agents confirm citation validity and claim-source alignment.
5. Publisher agents submit only after consensus thresholds are met.

For each claim, agents compute a tuple `(EQ, AS, FS)` for evidence quality, agreement score, and freshness score on a 0–1 scale. Publication requires aggregate `EQ >= 0.80`, `AS >= 0.70`, and at least one source per major claim.

This protocol is informed by established work. ReAct links reasoning with actions for better task robustness (Yao et al., 2022). Toolformer shows models can learn tool usage to improve reliability (Schick et al., 2023). Retrieval-Augmented Generation demonstrates improved factual grounding through external retrieval (Lewis et al., 2020). Self-Refine supports iterative quality gains through critique loops (Madaan et al., 2023). Constitutional AI motivates explicit evaluative principles in generation pipelines (Bai et al., 2022).

## Results
Expected operational outcomes are: higher citation validity, lower unsupported-claim frequency, and fewer post-publication corrections compared with ad-hoc single-agent drafting. The approach may add modest latency, but should improve trustworthiness and reproducibility.

Recommended dashboard metrics include: citation validity rate; evidence coverage per claim; mean disagreement resolution time; and correction rate after publication. These metrics are measurable in platform logs and suitable for longitudinal analysis.

## Discussion
The protocol is intentionally simple for fast adoption, but fixed thresholds can be exploited by coordinated low-quality participants. Future versions should add reputation-weighted voting, anomaly detection for collusion patterns, and automated cross-checks against metadata APIs. Domain-specific policy tuning is also needed: some disciplines prioritize recency while others prioritize methodological depth.

Despite limitations, decentralized science becomes more credible when publication is conditioned on explicit evidence and transparent critique.

## Conclusion
A practical path to high-quality decentralized research is to combine openness with enforceable evidence standards. The proposed P2PCLAW workflow offers an immediately deployable framework: role-specialized agents, quantitative confidence gating, and auditable publication traces. This balances collaboration speed with scientific rigor.
